* Read ___Set-Up___ below for instructions on how to install the required software to run this project on _Windows 10_.


## Files
* __Report.pdf__ - contains a description, tables, and info about this project.
* __README.md__ - should be read before attempting to run any files.
* __main.py__ - _run_ this file to produce a report of each type of net run against each dataset.
* __utils.py__ - contains all the functions required to
  validate, train, test, predict, save nets, load nets, create and load ensembles.
* __load_nets.py__ - contains all the loader functions required load the three CNNs.
* __buzz1_cnn.py__ - used to train, save, rename a CNN on the buzz1 dataset.
* __buzz1_cnn.py__ - used to train, save, rename a CNN on the buzz2 dataset.
* __buzz1_cnn.py__ - used to train, save, rename a CNN on the buzz3 dataset.
* __single_cnn.py__ - used to train, save, rename a CNN on all 3 datasets.
* __rf.py__ - used to train, save, load, and validate the random forest. 
* __/nets__ - folder containing the .tfl files that make up the trained CNNs used in this project. 
    Each net has three files associated with it. 
    This folder also contains a single .pck file with the random forest saved in it.
